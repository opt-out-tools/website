      Our model analyzes the sentiment of an entire comment to tell whether it’s misogynistic or not. How have we done
      this? Well let’s start with the dataset.
    </p>
    <h2>Collecting the Data</h2>
    <p>
      We built the dataset by searching for tweets with key terms in them, such as "camel toe", which happens to be a
      strong indicator of misogyny language <a href="http://github.com/opt-out-tools/study-online-misogyny">we have found</a> .
    </p>

    <p>
      There are obvious limitations to this approach, as your search is only as good as you are mean. We then decided to
      search for the names of politicians and other public women such as @UnburntWitch (
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy">Zoë Quinn</a>, the games developer affected by
      Gamergate) so that we captured the abuse rather than guessed. Using this technique, we got a lot of tweets, but
      the data was heavily diluted, meaning that the number of misogynistic tweets was low in comparison to the number
      of non-misogynistic tweets. We then reached out to our academic community to boost the number of misogynistic
      tweets. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3M3WdvkAAAAJ&hl=en">Zeerak Waseem</a>  gave us his
      annotated dataset, which allowed us to move on to labeling our tweets.

    <h2>
      Labeling it
    </h2>
    <p>We classified tweets as misogynistic if they showed one of the following traits*:</p>


    <h3 class="color_1">Insult</h3>
    <p>
      Disrespect or scornful verbal abuse with no other larger intention than to hurt, degrade or belittle a person.
    </p>
    <aside>“@GretaThunberg That's just a start to the hypocrisy from climate Nazis.”</aside>


    <h3 class="color_2">Sexual Harassment</h3>
    <p>
      Harassment that is sexualized, including talks of a sexual nature and graphic sexual descriptions, sexual
      innuendos, sexual slurs, offensive and persistent risqué jokes or jesting and kidding about sex or
      gender-specific traits.
    </p>
    <aside>
      “#MKR has to be scripted. Meat girls serving cock who sprayed sorbet all over the
      kitchen? I've seen porn just like this...”
    </aside>

    <h3 class="color_3">Threats of Violence</h3>
    <p>
      Threats or comments that include an indication of a violent physical dimension.
    </p>
    <aside>“I just want to knock Kat's cocky face out #mkr”</aside>

    <h3 class="color_1">Gender essentialism</h3>
    <p>
      Attribution of fixed, intrinsic, innate qualities to women and men because of their biological gender, such as
      differences between women and men’s personalities/behaviors, women being innately more nurturing than men and
      mothers naturally more sensitive to a baby’s feelings than fathers.
    </p>
    <aside>
      “@ZackFord @femfreq So stop crying and make some movies with female
      protagonists. Or is whining all you are good for?”
    </aside>

    <h3 class="color_2">Transmisogyny</h3>
    <p>
      Negative attitudes expressed through cultural hate, individual and state violence, and discrimination toward
      trans-women and trans and gender non-conforming people on the feminine end of the gender spectrum.
    </p>
    <aside>
      “Nice knobbly knees”
      Hashtags might include #womanface #transcult #genderfree #sexnotgender
      #gendercritical (...)
    </aside>

    <h3 class="color_3">Objectification</h3>
    <p>
      View of woman as objects rather than as individuals.
    </p>
    <aside>
      “These two blondes are not skinny enough to be models. #MKR”
    </aside>

    <h3 class="color_1">Derailing</h3>
    <p>
      Interrupting someone in order to change the conversation to something that the perpetrator feels more
      authoritative talking about or to reassert their preferred norms.
    </p>
    <aside>“RT @TheDarkManChris: Call me sexist but I think some women are seriously lacking
      knowledge l when it comes to feminism #random”</aside>

      Here we present a data statement, proposed by
      <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/people/e/emily-m-bender/">Emily M. Bender</a>  et. al., as a way to
      simply communicate important details about our dataset. With this, we hope to address critical ethical issues that
      result from machine learning modeling. Through transparency about the limitations of our modeling, we hope to help
      alleviate issues related to exclusion and bias in language technology.

      <h2>Modeling</h2>
      <p>
        We’re using a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> model
        to classify the tweets as misogynistic or not. This is a common and excellent type of linear algorithm to use
        initially, while we get up on our feet. Statistics power the model using
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">stochastic descent</a> — the optimization
        procedure. The result is a solution that works effectively with most learning problems.

      <h2>How the Browser Extension works</h2>
      <p>
        The mechanics of the extension is very simple. We have a model sat on
        <a href="https://softerrific.com/">Softerrific’s</a> servers. As the page loads the tweets are sent to the
        backend, the model is hit and returns a score. If the score indicates the content is misogynistic, the text is
        hidden, if not it’s left on the page. For our initial alpha version of the browser extension, that is as complex
        as it needs to be.

      <h2>Our Next Labeling Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Whilst our long-term goal is to be able to protect everyone affected by online misogynistic harassment, we are
        committed to first supporting those who face the most misogyny online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many female politicians across the globe
        are forced to contend with misogyny on a regular basis, sometimes even resulting in these politicians <a
        href="https://womensmediacenter.com/speech-project/nameitchangeit">stepping down</a> from their positions. If a
        politician also happens to be black, trans, obese, or any other intersecting identity that is already
        discriminated against, the intensity and amount of abuse increases. Our next focus will be on protecting the
        voices of black female politicians, as we have found they
        <a href="https://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/troll-patrol/findings">disproportionately</a> suffer from online
        misogyny. It is vital to be this precise for our initial modeling. Our next step will then be to increase
        inclusivity as we learn how we can model misogyny better.

      <h2>Our Next Modeling Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Improving our modeling is vital. Our next focus will look into the effect of the user profiles and network effects
        to improve the accuracy of our classification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Misogyny is multilingual. Our second goal will be to achieve misogyny modeling in multiple languages. Using data
        augmentation tools, we shall be able to generate different labeled datasets, the first step to multilingual
        misogyny language detection and often the biggest bottleneck in any data science study.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to this, we have begun a study into understanding the linguistic structure of online misogynistic
        harassment.

      <h4>Local Model and Custom filtering</h4>
      <p>
        We need women to know they are in control of what they do and don’t see with the help of our browser extension, by
        giving feedback to our machine learning model. For this we’ll need a client-side data pipeline, that handles
        everything from data storage to model testing, and needs to work in a way that is accessible to non-technical
        people and transparent about what it is doing.
