    <h1>Vision</h1>
    <p>
      At Opt Out Tools, affectionately known as OOT, we're building tech to help everyone with something to say to
      participate in healthy online discussion safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want social media platforms to be a respectful place where anyone can comment without fear if misogynistic
      backlash. We want online debate to be inclusive so all voices can flourish. We want social networks to be safer
      places for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to achieve this by building tools and an organization with consent, privacy and transparency at their core.

        specifically champion the values below.
      </p>

          to die down</li>

        <li><h2 class="purple">Inclusivity</h2> We want all respectful voices to flourish</li>

              tech industry after a degree in Chemistry and a first job as a Java Developer for a bank. As the only
              woman in a man-club team, Teresa understood the struggle of women being silenced offline and she decided
              to build something that could empower women on the internet!

            <p>
              Andrada's biggest passion is using Data Science to decrease the digital divide; hate speech detection
              against female-identifying people is a big part of this. To Andrada, language defines our experience of
              the internet. To make the internet more inclusive and avoid people being excluded from important
              conversations, Andrada wants to contribute to the development of language technology that is fair and
              accurate for any language, especially when it comes to detecting and combating hate speech online.
